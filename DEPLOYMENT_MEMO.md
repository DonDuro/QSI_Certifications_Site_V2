## Completed Deployment Preparations

### 1. Platform Independence Achieved
- **Removed all Replit dependencies:** Eliminated `@replit/vite-plugin-cartographer` and `@replit/vite-plugin-runtime-error-modal`
- **Created clean configuration:** Developed `vite.config.deployment.ts` for platform-agnostic deployment
- **Automated cleanup process:** Deployment scripts automatically handle dependency removal

### 2. Comprehensive Documentation Created
- **DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md:** 200+ line comprehensive guide covering local development, content management, database operations, and AWS deployment procedures
- **README.md:** Professional GitHub repository documentation with setup instructions and feature overview
- **.env.example:** Environment configuration template for secure credential management

### 3. Production-Ready Infrastructure Files
- **Dockerfile:** Multi-stage build configuration for containerized deployment
- **docker-compose.yml:** Complete stack orchestration with PostgreSQL and Nginx
- **nginx.conf:** Production-ready reverse proxy with SSL, security headers, and performance optimization
- **ecosystem.config.js:** PM2 process management configuration for high-availability deployment
- **.ebextensions/nodejs.config:** AWS Elastic Beanstalk deployment configuration

### 4. Automated Deployment Scripts
- **scripts/deploy.sh:** Automated deployment script supporting multiple environments (production, staging, Docker)
- **Integrated cleanup:** Automatic Replit dependency removal during deployment process
- **Environment flexibility:** Support for EC2, Elastic Beanstalk, and Docker deployment strategies
